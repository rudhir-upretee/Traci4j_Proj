/**
 * Represents a query to retrieve a value. This class is able to
 * communicate directly with SUMO to run the query.
 * <p>
 * Calling the {@link #get()} method runs the query immediately: the query's
 * requests are sent to SUMO; responses from SUMO are received and processed.
 * The returned value is cached internally and any subsequent calls to
 * {@link #get()} will return that value and avoid another dialog with SUMO,
 * unless the subclass calls {@link #setObsolete()};
 * <p>
 * Please note that using the immediate execution can be slow; to increase
 * performance, it is recommended to use a {@link MultiQuery}.
